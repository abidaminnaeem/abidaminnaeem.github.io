# 👋 About Me

I’m **Muhammad Abid**, a researcher in *Computational Science, Engineering, and Mathematics* with a focus on **Scientific Machine Learning**, **Mathematical Modeling**, and **Scientific Computing**. I’m passionate about addressing complex real-world challenges through rigorous mathematical frameworks and data-driven approaches.

Currently pursuing my PhD in Aerospace & Mechanical Engineering at the University of Tennessee, I’ve contributed to international research efforts in **uncertainty quantification**, **parametric simulations**, and **neural PDE solvers**. My work bridges the gap between theoretical mathematics and applied machine learning, particularly in modeling dynamic systems where data is scarce but precision is critical.

I’ve had the privilege of teaching undergraduate courses in **optimization**, **fluid mechanics**, and **numerical analysis**, and I continue to mentor and collaborate across academic and industrial domains.
